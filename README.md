# Flame Cursor Extension

Add a fiery spark to your coding experience! This extension adds a flame icon (‚ö°Ô∏è) after every character you type, creating a cool visual effect. The flame icon appears briefly and disappears, giving your cursor a dynamic and fun look.

## Features

- Adds a flame icon (üî•) after each character you type.
- Simple and lightweight.
- Customizable animation speed (coming soon!).

## Installation

1. Download the `.vsix` file from the releases section.
2. Open VS Code or Cursor.
3. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
4. Click on the three dots (...) and select **Install from VSIX...**.
5. Choose the `.vsix` file and install the extension.
6. Reload your editor and start typing to see the flame effect!

## How It Works

When you type a character, a flame icon (üî•) appears briefly after it. The icon disappears after a short delay, creating a smooth animation effect.

## Future Updates

- Add more customization options (e.g., different icons, colors, and animation styles).
- Allow users to adjust the animation speed.
