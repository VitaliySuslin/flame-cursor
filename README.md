# Flame Cursor Extension

Add a fiery spark to your coding experience! This extension adds a flame icon (‚ö°Ô∏è) after every character you type, creating a cool visual effect. The flame icon appears briefly and disappears, giving your cursor a dynamic and fun look.

## Features

- Adds a flame icon (üî•) after each character you type.
- Simple and lightweight.
- Customizable animation speed (coming soon!).

## Installation

### For Users

1. Download the `.vsix` file from the releases section.
2. Open **VS Code** or **Cursor**.
3. Go to **Extensions** (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
4. Click on the three dots (...) and select **Install from VSIX...**.
5. Choose the `.vsix` file and install the extension.
6. Reload your editor and start typing to see the flame effect!

### For Developers

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/flame-cursor.git
   cd flame-cursor
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the project:

   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

4. Package the extension into a `.vsix` file:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @vscode/vsce
   vsce package
   ```

5. Install the `.vsix` file in your IDE (VS Code or Cursor) as described in the **For Users** section.

## How It Works

When you type a character, a flame icon (üî•) appears briefly after it. The icon disappears after a short delay, creating a smooth animation effect.

## Future Updates

- Add more customization options (e.g., different icons, colors, and animation styles).
- Allow users to adjust the animation speed.
